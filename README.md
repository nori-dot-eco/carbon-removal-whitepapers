# How to Add Feedback

This repository houses a [whitepaper](<https://github.com/nori-dot-eco/carbon-removal-whitepapers/blob/main/cdr-blended-tonne.md>) detailing a new carbon removal product concept from [Nori](<http://www.nori.com>), which we are currently calling the "Blended Tonne". Embodying Nori's commitment to transparency, we've chosen an open-source approach for feedback. As of August 9th, 2023, we've closed our comment period for this whitepaper, but please feel free to reach out at [hello@nori.com](<mailto:hello@nori.com>) if you'd like to get in touch.

Thank you for your stopping by!
