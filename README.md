# How to Add Feedback

This repository houses a [whitepaper](<https://github.com/nori-dot-eco/carbon-removal-whitepapers/blob/main/cdr-blended-tonne.md>) detailing a new carbon removal product concept from [Nori](<http://www.nori.com>), which we are currently calling the "Blended Tonne". Embodying Nori's commitment to transparency, we've chosen an open-source approach for feedback. We invite you to contribute your thoughts, questions, relevant insights, and suggestions to refine the product concept further.

For easy and structured interaction, we employ GitHub’s "Issues" feature. Here's how to add your feedback:
1) Access [the "Issues" section](<https://github.com/nori-dot-eco/carbon-removal-whitepapers/issues>): This link is positioned between the "Code" and "Pull Requests" options.
2) Initiate a new issue: Simply click on the green "New issue" button.
3) Share your thoughts: Assign an appropriate title and type out your feedback in the designated box.
4) Submit your feedback: Click on the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom to make your contribution.

Thank you for your valuable feedback and engagement. We look forward to incorporating your insights to enhance the "Blended Tonne" concept.
